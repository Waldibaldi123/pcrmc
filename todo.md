# TODO

- replace 'echo' and 'secho' functions with print
- use typer.Abort() instead of normal Exit (looks kinda nice in cli)
- Option prombt useful for filling out eg a form
- configure cli auto completion with python package
- state can be kept in extra json file, for example
    1) view contact -> viewed contact saved in state
    2) add meeting -> if no specifier is given, last viewed contact is used
- make alias for "python -m pcrmc"
